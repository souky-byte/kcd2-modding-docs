In effort to make the modding as accessible as possible we are publishing the rools required for example to export an asset or to create it. Here is step-by-step guide how to **enable** and/or **disable** our tools in 3ds Max installation.

## **First find these folders on your machine**

`{max installation}` = `c:/program files/autodesk/3ds max/3ds max 20??`

`{local max files}` = `c:/users/your.name/appdata/local/autodesk/3dsmax/20?? - {32|64}bit/enu`

`{path to installation}` = `Path to where Steam installed your modding tools.`

You may need to do a little bit searching for these folders if you have installed your 3ds Max into a non-standard location.

## **How to enable our tools**

1. Update to **3ds Max 2021.1** if you have not done so already.

2. Open 3ds Max and go to **Customize/Configure User and System Paths** and under **3rd Party Plug-Ins** click **Add** and find your plugin folder. The location will look like this: `{path to installation}/Tools/`**`enviro`**`/3dsmax/v23/native_plugins`

3. Click **Use Path**.

4. Quit 3ds Max.

5. Copy `{path to installation}/Tools/modding/3dsmax/scripts/LoadWHMaxTools.ms` to `{max installation}/scripts/startup`.

6. Copy `{path to installation}/Tools/modding/3dsmax/v23/libs/libgmp-10.dll`
   and `{path to installation}/Tools/modding/3dsmax/v23/libs/gmp-10.dll` to `{max installation}`.

7. Run `{path to installation}/Tools/SettingsMgr.exe` to setup CryEngine Exporter path.

8. Run 3ds Max and the tools should be working properly.

   (if max still have problem find plugins, copy files **gmp-10.dll** and **libgmp-10.dll** from folder ***{path to installation}\Tools\modding\3dsmax\v23\libs*** to folder **C:\Windows\System32**. It should work now.)

## **How to disable our tools**

If our tools cause problems for you, you can disable them.

1. Open 3ds Max and go to **Customize/Configure User and System Paths** and under **3rd Party Plug-Ins** click **Delete** for any item that points to our WH files (`{path to installation}`)
2. Delete `{max installation}/scripts/startup/LoadWHMaxTools.ms`.
3. Also delete the local files in `{local max files}/temp/wh`. Delete the whole folder.
4. Delete`{max installation}/gmp-10.dll` and `{max installation}/libgmp-10.dll`.
5. Now your 3ds Max should be WH-free.
